**Greetings, from your new best friend.**

Sesame is an accessible Open-Source robotics project based on the ESP32 microcontroller system, with an emphasis on expression and movement. 
This project is designed for makers and engineers of all skill levels! Sesame offers a dynamic platform designed to start working with walking robots. 
To build a sesame robot, you will need basic soldering skills, $50-60 in hardware components, access to a 3D printer, and a basic understanding of Arduino IDE.

This repository contains the CAD design files, STL files, build and wiring guides, and the base/expanded firmware for the ESP32-based controller. 
There is also some included debugging firmware that may be helpful in getting your Sesame up and running.

## Features

*   **Quadruped Design:** Uses 8 servo motors (2 per leg) to achieve roughly 8 total degrees of freedom.
*   **Emotive Display:** Features a 128x64 OLED screen acting as a reactive face that syncs with movement.
*   **Fully Printable:** Designed entirely for 3D printing in PLA with minimal supports.
*   **Network Connectivity:** Connect to your WiFi network for remote control and API access.
*   **JSON API:** RESTful API for programmatic control from Python, JavaScript, and more.
*   **Conversational Faces:** Expressive emotion library with talk variants for voice assistant projects.
*   **Sesame Studio:** New animation composer software to easily create custom movements.
*   **Sesame Companion App:** Python application for voice control and advanced interactions.
*   **Serial CLI:** Control the robot and trigger animations via a Serial Command Line Interface or the web UI.
*   **Pre-programmed Emotes:** Includes animations for Walking, Waving, Dancing, Pointing, Resting, and more.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build your own Sesame Robot:

### 1. Gather Parts 
Check the **[Bill of Materials (BOM)](hardware/bom/README.md)** for a complete list of required electronics and hardware.
*   Microcontroller: Lolin S2 Mini (recommended for DIY builds), Sesame Distro Board V2 (included in Build Kits, pre-flashed), or ESP32-DevKitC-32E with Distro Board V1 (legacy)
*   Actuators: 8x MG90 Servos
*   Power: 5V 3A source (USB-C PD for S2 Mini and V2 Distro Board, or battery + buck converter; see BOM for the 2× 10440 Li-ion + 2× AAA holder option)

### 2. Print Parts 
Download the STLs and follow the **[Printing Guide](hardware/printing/README.md)**.
*   Designed for PLA
*   Minimal supports required

### 3. Build & Wire 
Follow the **[Build Guide](docs/build-guide/README.md)** and **[Wiring Guide](docs/wiring-guide/README.md)** to assemble the frame and connect the electronics.

### 4. Flash Firmware 
Upload the code from the **[Firmware Directory](firmware/README.md)**.
*   Requires Arduino IDE
*   Configure WiFi AP settings

### 5. Create Animations 
Use **[Sesame Studio](software/sesame-studio/README.md)** to visually design poses and sequences for your robot.

## Software & Firmware

### Sesame Studio
Sesame Studio is a standalone desktop application included in `software/sesame-studio/`. It allows you to:
*   Visually pose the robot using a schematic interface.
*   Generate C++ code for servo angles automatically.
*   Sequence frames into complex animations.

[**> Go to Sesame Studio**](software/sesame-studio/README.md)

### Sesame Companion App
The Sesame Companion App is a Python-based application that enables advanced control and interaction with your robot over your local network. It leverages the new JSON API and network mode features to provide:
*   **Voice Assistant Integration:** Control Sesame with voice commands and see real-time emotional expressions.
*   **Remote Control:** Command your robot from anywhere on your local network.
*   **Face Control:** Change expressions dynamically based on conversation or context.
*   **API Examples:** Reference implementation for building your own integrations.

The Companion App works with robots running the latest firmware with network mode enabled.

[**> Go to Sesame Companion App Repository**](https://github.com/dorianborian/sesame-companion-app)

### Firmware
The ESP32 firmware (`sesame-firmware-main.ino`) handles the kinematics, face display, and WiFi control interface.
*   **Web UI:** Control the robot from your phone via the built-in Access Point.
*   **Custom Faces:** Add your own bitmaps (guide in firmware docs).

[**> Go to Firmware Docs**](firmware/README.md)

## Contributing

This robot is a platform for building new features, cosmetics, tools, and ideas. Since the current firmware is a basic implementation, pull requests are very welcome for:
*   Kinematics improvements
*   New animations
*   Improved Web UI/UX
*   Sensor integration (Ultrasonic, Gyro, etc.)

I would also love to see forks of this project with new hardware, software, faces, etc. Be sure to send me a message if you end up building one, and I might feature you on my website or channel!
