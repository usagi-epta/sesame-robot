## Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow existing code formatting in the project
- Comment your code where necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Hardware Contributions
- Provide files in common formats (STL for 3D models, PDF for schematics)
- Include source files when possible (native CAD formats)
- Document design decisions and requirements
- Test prints before submitting

### Documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include images and diagrams
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Test instructions by following them yourself

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add details in the commit body if needed

Example:
```
Add ultrasonic sensor integration example

- Added example code for HC-SR04 sensor
- Included wiring diagram
- Updated BOM with sensor information
```
