| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ESP32-DevKitC-32E (ESP32-WROOM-32) | 1 | Base board the Distro Board V1 stacks on. This one is very tricky because its a very specific board. You can use the 32E with the floating pcb antenna OR you can use the 32U but you have to route an antenna inside. | [link](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ESP32+DevKitC+32) |

## Power & Safety Notes

- Sesame needs at least 5 V at 3 A available at the rails. 
- **Lolin S2 Mini:** Can be powered via USB-C PD (5V/3A capable) for tethered operation, or via battery + buck converter.
- **Distro Board V2:** Supports both USB-C PD (5V/3A) for tethered operation AND battery + buck converter. Included in all Sesame Build Kits.
- **Distro Board V1 (Legacy):** Cannot run on tethered USB-C power due to design limitations. Must use battery + buck converter for operation.
- When battery powering either build, route the pack through the rocker switch and buck converter before it touches the rails, mirroring the schematic in [docs/wiring-guide/README.md](../../docs/wiring-guide/README.md).
- **Never cut the factory battery connector off the pack.** Instead, create adapter pigtails using XT30 or JST RCY leads so the pack remains chargeable.
- A 2× 10440 Li-ion + 2× AAA holder pack fits the stock battery cavity and works well with the existing power switch + buck converter.
- **Always remove and charge 10440 cells separately in a proper Li-ion charger.** Do not charge them while inside the AAA holder unless the holder explicitly supports safe Li-ion charging (most do not).
