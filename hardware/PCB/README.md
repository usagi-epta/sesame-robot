# PCB Schematics

Electronic schematics and wiring diagrams for the Sesame Distro Board, a custom PCB just for the Sesame Robot Project. The distro boar pairs with the ESP32-DevKitC-32E.


**PCBway Sponsorship**

This project was sponsored by [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/), who manufactured the custom distro boards. PCBway offers high-quality PCB fabrication services with fast turnaround times and excellent customer support. You can order your own Sesame Distro Boards by uploading the Gerber files (found in the hardware section) to their website.

If you're building your own Sesame Robot, PCBway is a great option for getting professional-quality distro boards manufactured at reasonable prices.

## How to order one:

1. Download the Gerber archive `Gerber_Sesame-Distro-Board_PCB_Sesame-Distro-Board_V1.zip` from this directory.
2. Upload that zip file to PCBway as the project Gerber bundle and confirm the board thickness and finish match the Sesame Distro Board requirements.
3. Double-check the provided drill, solder mask, and silkscreen layers in the preview before placing the order to ensure the traces and cutouts stay consistent with the schematic.
4. Specify the desired quantity and shipping options, then submit the order to receive professionally fabricated Sesame Distro Boards.
